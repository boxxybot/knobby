# knobby
As a basic entity, knobby allows control of 2048 things with 5 knobs. Those 2048 things are, in this case, MIDI control messages to knobby's internal synth engine.
Knobby's synth engine presently has 2 voltage controlled filters, 5 vcos for the two filters, and a multitude of mixer channels to control modulation from 3 lfos and 4 adsr generators as well as a line input envelope follower. One voice of knobby is 4 note FM polyphonic with six operators for each note, meaning knobby's synth engine actually has something more than 50 VCOs, 20 ADSR generators, etc. It's meant to emulate a nice rack of patchable gear as much as possible, sort of like an Arp 2600 combined with a minimoog  and a (limited) Yamaha DX without all the jacks and cables and (only five) knobs. Multiple knobby can be chained, allowing multiple points of access to controls or more than one person to play in a group.

With only 5 knobs, knobby is easy to build and easy to operate. The  combination of colors presented by "knobby" (the main control knob) and the four control
knobs determine what parameters one is controlling at the time. It works like this: https://youtu.be/uNARHQ3IWLY
